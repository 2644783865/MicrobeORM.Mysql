<hr/>

In version 2.0 ,with Nunit Test and show how to use...
<br/>
i think this may be the most highly frequency operation of the data layer.
insert one or insert mulity.
read by identity or by conditon.
update an entity or by condition.
delete an entity or be condition.

orther complex operation ,you can use execute sql or use procture or funtion....
at the NUnit Project.you can compare the performance of this tool and the native ADO.NET provider by mysql....
singel may slow ,but mulity is fast!!
